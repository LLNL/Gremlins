              Emulating Exascale Conditions on Today's Platforms

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

The GREMLINs emulate the behavior of anticipated future architectures on 
current machines. We focus on the impact of resource limitations (by 
artificially restricting them), as well as noise and faults by using injection 
techniques--these issues are generally expected to be the dominating challenges 
in future machine generations.

We have four different classes of GREMLINS: 

(1) Power: artificially reduce the operating power using DVFS or cap power on a 
per node basis; 
(2) Memory: limit resources in the memory hierarchy such as cache size or 
memory bandwidth by running interference threads; 
(3) Reselience: inject faults into target applications and enable us to study 
the efficiency and correctness of recovery techniques;
(4) Noise: inject periodic or random noise events to emulate system and OS 
interference
