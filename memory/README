For Reference, see:
   Marc Casas, Greg Bronevetsky: 
   Active Measurement of Memory Resource Consumption.

By running carefully-calibrated threads alongside codes of interest, we can 
emulate reduced bandwidth and capacity across the whole of the memory hierarchy.  

The following lines might be needed in your msub-script for papi:
. /usr/local/tools/dotkit/init.sh
use papi


To run this Gremlin with two interference Processes, use:
export N_CONTS=2
export N_CORES=4 #N_CORES is the total number of Processes (Application + Contamination)

For METRIC=1 run initial tests with a Buffer size of 100000-150000
For METRIC=2 higher Buffer sizes show the desired resutls (~10M-100M)

Testing with different number of intereference processes and buffer size is encouraged!
