Performance optimization under a power bound is the primary novel challenge of exascale computing.  To explore this space, developers need to understand the power characteristics of their code as well as how it reacts to low-power scenarios.  Our Power GREMLIN enabled measuring and capping both cpu package and DRAM power by using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) technology on Intel processors.
