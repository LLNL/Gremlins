Livermore Unstructured Lagrange Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics (LULESH) v1.0

LULESH v1.0 is a C++ 3D Finite Element Lagrange Hydrodynamics code
solving the inviscid Euler equations using artificial viscosity and
Flanagan-Belytschko-type hourglass control. It solves a standard
analytical test problem, known as the Sedov problem.  In this problem,
a quantum of energy is deposited into a gas and propagates through the
gas over time.

The code is a benchmark to be used to evaluate advanced architectures
and does not purport to be accurate to materials science models or
processes.  It attempts to capture representative floating point and
memory access behavior of 3d continuum hydrodynamic software.
