Performance at exascale will not only be constrained by power but by thermal considerations as well.  In addition, continuous execution at high power requires active cooling which in turn consumes more power.  Our Thermal GREMLIN allows developers access to per-core temperature sensors to track how code creates heat.  We are exploring the possibility of augmenting this gremlin with an interface to package thermal capping:  when the processor reaches the user-specified limit, performance degrades until the lower temperature is restored.
